## Attributes of a blog

### Template (Header)
**Why set**

For different blog, we may use different templates. 
The default value is configured in the `config.js`.

**How to set**

In the blog header and the available values are:

- Light
- Dark
- ...

### Â Status (Label)
**Set in the issue's label**
1. **Draft**: draft status and not ready to be published.
2. **Completed**: document can be published.
3. **Deleted**: document is removed.

**Priority**: Deleted > Completed > Draft

### Category (Label)
**Set in the issue's label**

- Thinkings
- Life
- Technology

### Other labels (Label)
**Set in the issue's label**
Since we write blog in issues, we could add other label for quicker index.

The reservered words contains words in  **Status** and **Category**.

### SEO (Header)
**Set in the blog's header**
For SEO, I prefer to add those information in the document.

- Keywords (Not important as before, keywords + all the labels will be the keywords generated)
- Description (The blog's purpose)
- Title(default is the blog title)
